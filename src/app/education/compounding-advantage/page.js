              Compounding is often called the "eighth wonder of the world" for good reason. It's the process where your investment earnings generate their own earnings, 
              creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth that can turn modest, regular contributions into substantial wealth over time.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Power of Compounding</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Compounding works by reinvesting your earnings, allowing them to generate additional returns. This creates exponential growth because:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600">
              <li>Your original investment continues to grow</li>
              <li>Your earnings generate their own earnings</li>
              <li>The growth accelerates over time</li>
              <li>Small differences in returns can lead to large differences in final value</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Time: The Most Powerful Factor</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The longer your money compounds, the more dramatic the effect. Consider these key points:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600">
              <li>Starting early gives your money more time to grow</li>
              <li>Regular contributions amplify the compounding effect</li>
              <li>Even small amounts can grow significantly over decades</li>
              <li>Consistency is more important than the size of contributions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real-World Example</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Let's compare two investors:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600">
              <li>Investor A starts at age 25, contributes $300/month for 10 years, then stops</li>
              <li>Investor B starts at age 35, contributes $300/month for 30 years</li>
              <li>Both earn 7% annual return</li>
              <li>At age 65, Investor A has more money despite contributing less total</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              This example shows how starting early and letting compounding work its magic can be more powerful than contributing larger amounts for longer periods.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Maximizing the Compounding Effect</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              To make the most of compounding:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600">
              <li>Start investing as early as possible</li>
              <li>Make regular, consistent contributions</li>
              <li>Reinvest all dividends and interest</li>
              <li>Minimize fees and expenses</li>
              <li>Stay invested through market cycles</li>
            </ul>
